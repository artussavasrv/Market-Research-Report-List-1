<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ventilator for Critical Care Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive</li><li>Non-Invasive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The ventilator market for critical care is divided into two primary types: invasive and non-invasive. Invasive ventilators involve the use of artificial airways, such as endotracheal tubes, to deliver oxygen directly to the lungs, providing comprehensive respiratory support for patients in severe distress. Non-invasive ventilators, on the other hand, support breathing through facial masks or nasal interfaces, enabling treatment without intubation, making them suitable for less severe cases or for patients with chronic conditions who need assistance.</p></p>
