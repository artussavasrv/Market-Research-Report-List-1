<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Compaction Grouting Service Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Loose Soil</li><li>Compactable Soft Soil</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Compaction grouting is a ground improvement technique used to enhance soil stability and load-bearing capacity. The market is distinguished into two primary types: loose soil and compactable soft soil. Loose soil involves granular materials with high void ratios that can benefit significantly from the injection of grout, reducing settlement risks. In contrast, compactable soft soil, often clay or silty materials, can be densified using grout to improve structural support, enhance drainage, and mitigate potential ground movement issues.</p></p>
